# SumUp

SumUp Challenge is an engaging and fast-paced React Native game designed to test how quickly and accurately you can select numbers that sum up to a given target. It's a mental workout that gets progressively harder the more you win!

## 𝐆𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞:

You’ll be presented with a random target number (e.g., 26) and six random numbers. Your challenge is to select the numbers that add up exactly to the target. Quick thinking and sharp attention to detail are key!

## 𝐆𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲:

- You have 10 seconds to find the correct combination of numbers.
- Pick the right numbers, and you win!
- Choose wrong or fail to find the solution within 10 seconds, and you lose.
- With each victory, the game ramps up in difficulty, pushing your skills to the next level.
